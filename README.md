### Custom Assets

MikuMikuMixed itself does not store any model/movement/music files, all of which are taken from third parties. If you want to use custom assets, you'll need to deal with file storage and CORS issues on your own.

For example, miku_v2 for three.js is stored here: [/examples/models/mmd/miku/miku_v2.pmd](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/models/mmd/miku/miku_v2.pmd)

Then you can get it from jsdelivr using the following url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrdoob/three.js/examples/models/mmd/miku/miku_v2.pmd
